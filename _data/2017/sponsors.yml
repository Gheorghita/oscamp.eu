        The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect,
        and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate
        the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.
        The majority of the PSF's work is focused on empowering and supporting
        people within the Python community. The PSF has active grant programs
        that support sprints, conferences, meetups, user groups, and Python
        development efforts all over the world. In addition, the PSF underwrites
        and runs PyCon US, the primary Python community conference. Being part of
        the PSF means being part of the Python community. Recently we changed the
        PSF to an open membership organization, so that everyone who uses and
        supports Python can join. To learn more, visit
        https://www.python.org/psf/membership.

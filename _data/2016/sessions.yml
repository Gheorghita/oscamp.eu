  title: "gitfs - Building a Python filesystem"
  description: >
    gitfs is an open-source filesystem which was designed to bring the full
    powers of Git to everyone, no matter how little they know about versioning.
    A user can mount any repository and all the his changes will be automatically
    converted into commits. gitfs will also expose the history of the branch youâ€™re
    currently working on by simulating snapshots of every commit.

  title: "OpenStreetMap - The Wikipedia of Google Maps"
  description: >
    We have Google Maps, so why the need for another "map"?
    If tomorrow Google decides to close the project, what will you,
    as a user, do?

    Maybe write a status on Facebook? Maybe build a petition, or try
    to boycott their other products. But that is all. If Google decides
    to kill a project, that project is dead.

    If tomorrow OpenStreetMap closes, you just download the database,
    you put it on your server and that's it, OpenStreetMap goes on.
    Exit the paradigm of looking at a map as if it was just a map. In digital
    form, a map is so much more.

    OpenStreetMap is formed by:

    - A community of 2.2 million volunteers, which wish to build a better map
    of the world. Like a Wikipedia for maps.
    - An ecosystem formed by programers which develop applications and websites
    which use the data from OpenStreeMap.
    - Tens of thousans of websites that use the OSM maps, starting with Apple,
    Wikipedia, Flickr, Pinterest, Foursquare, Booking.com, Evernote, Craigslist
    etc.

    What OpenStreetMap is not?

    OpenStreetMap is not a map. OpenStreetMap is a database.
    Used in over 300 applications which reuse a part of the data in OpenStreetMap.
    There is a map which is specially crafted to show the accessibility for
    handicaped people.
    There is a map which shows you where you can find the nearest free WiFi.
    Everything is documented and Open Source.
    If you want your own map, you can easily build it.

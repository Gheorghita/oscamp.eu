  description: >
    gitfs is an open-source filesystem which was designed to bring the full
    powers of Git to everyone, no matter how little they know about versioning.
    A user can mount any repository and all the his changes will be automatically
    converted into commits. gitfs will also expose the history of the branch youâ€™re
    currently working on by simulating snapshots of every commit.

  bio: >
    Community evangelist, in the past three years I’ve build interest
    around Python and OpenStack, by creating and developing local meetup
    groups and national events. I’ve been involved in both open-source
    and Microsoft related communities and user groups, trying to bridge
    the gap between the two. 

    At Cloudbase, I’ve been in charge of developing our relation with
    local user groups and universities, by implementing "summer of code"
    type programs, trainings, workshops and hands-on labs, also meant to
    accelerate the adoption of certain tehnologies (Python, Go, OpenStack
    & Hyper-V) in the academic environment and help integrate students
    into existing communities.
